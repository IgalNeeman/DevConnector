## Full Stack project - MERN Stack Front To Back.

* Building an extensive backend API with Node.js & Express


Creating a build script, securing our keys and deploy to Heroku using Git.

## UPDATE: The entire project was updated to use React Hooks, Async/Await and better overall code.

This is NOT an "Intro to React" or "Intro to Node" project. It is a practical hands on project for building an app using the incredible MERN stack. I do try and explain everything as I go so it is possible to follow without React/Node experience but it is recommended that you know at least the basics first.
